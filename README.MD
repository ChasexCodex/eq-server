The code consists of two sides:
Mobile App and an Admin Dashboard

The mobile app uses react native expo and connects to the backend via firebase API
the dashboard collects data about the earthquake from affected people via firebase and display them on a map.

for this prototype, we made a simulation tool that tries to mimic the response of thousands, and tests the functionality on the user side
by simulating an earthquake.
